ABOUT ANGULAR II

Angular 2 is the next version of Google’s massively popular MV* framework for building complex applications in the browser (and beyond).

Angular 2 comes with almost everything you need to build a complicated frontend web or mobile apps, from powerful templates to fast rendering, data management, HTTP services, form handling, and so much more.

This simple tutorial site was built by the Ionic team with the goal of getting developers using Angular 2 features as well as TypeScript/ES2015 quickly through simple, straight-to-the-point tutorials. We felt like the Angular 2 documentation available on the web was too wordy and complicated for beginners and we wanted to change that.

We hope you enjoy this simple introduction to Angular 2 and TypeScript, and please let us know if anything seems wrong or outdated by filing an issue on the repo.
