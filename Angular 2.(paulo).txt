Angular 2

Angular 2.0 was announced at the ng-Europe conference 22-23. September 2014.The drastic changes in the 2.0 version created considerable controversy among developers.On April 30, 2015, the Angular developers announced that Angular 2 moved from Alpha to Developer Preview.Angular 2 can be downloaded from the official website. Angular 2 moved to Beta in December 2015,and the first release candidate was published in May 2016. The final version was released on September 14, 2016.

Angular 2 is not a version upgrade, but a complete rewrite. The primary differences in Angular 2 over Angular 1 are:

   -Mobile development – desktop development is much easier when mobile performance issues are handled first
   -Modularity – much core functionality has moved to modules, producing a lighter, faster core
   -Modern browsers only – reducing the need for browser compatibility workarounds
   -Angular 2 recommends the use of Microsoft's TypeScript language, which introduces the following improvements:

        *Class-based Object Oriented Programming
        *Static Typing
        *Generics
        *Lambdas
   -TypeScript is a superset of ECMAScript 6, and is backwards compatible with ECMAScript 5 (i.e.: JavaScript). Angular 2 also includes the benefits of ES6:

        *Iterators
        *For/Of loops
        *Python-style generators
        *Reflection
    	*Improved dependency injection – bindings make it possible for dependencies to be named
    	*Dynamic loading
    	*Asynchronous template compilation
    	*Simpler Routing
    	*Diary.js logging – measures where time is spent, to identify bottlenecks[23]
    	*Replacing controllers and $scope with components and directives – a component is a directive with a template
    	*Reactive programming support using RxJS
